In these two directories, we explore what happens when we feed data from classes
that were not used in training into our network.  In the FCL folder, we store
the PredWeights that come out of the fully-connected layer, while in the no-FCL
folder, we store differences from output maps andmaps of all ones and all negative 
ones (for more info on how our no-FCL network works, see [cnn_no_fcl](../cnn_no_fcl).
This work was spearheaded by my collaborator Sophie, but I did provide some help 
(particularly with the actual networks and the Excel data analysis).
