# CNN_research
Summer research at Pázmány Péter Catholic University

## Collaborators
My research was funded by a 
[NSF IRES grant](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=12831) and
sponsored by Professor Michael Niemier at the University of Notre Dame, who I was in
frequent communication with throughout the summer (he was back in the United States).
Sophie Lancaster ([@slancas1](https://github.com/slancas1)), also an undergrad 
majoring in Computer Science at Notre Dame. My supervisor at Pázmány in Budapest 
was András Horvath.  András was extremely generous with his time, helping us learn 
TensorFlow, debug and write code, and understand difficult concepts.  We could not 
have done our research without him.

## Our Toolset
We used [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) to build and process neural 
networks. TensorFlow is a python library that integrates very nicely with
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org). See [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/)
if you are interested in learning to use TensorFlow.

## Convolutional Neural Networks
All of the networks we created throughout the research experience were Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNNs).  CNNs are a type of deep neural network extremely effective 
at processing, classifying, and recognizing images.  This 
[blog](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/) provides
a very good overview of CNNs.
