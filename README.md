# CNN_research
Summer research at Pázmány Péter Catholic University

## Collaborators
My research was funded by a 
[NSF IRES grant](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=12831) and
sponsored by Professor Michael Niemier at the University of Notre Dame, who I was in
frequent communication with throughout the summer (he was back in the United States).
Sophie Lancaster ([@slancas1](https://github.com/slancas1), also an undergrad 
majoring in Computer Science at Notre Dame. My supervisor in at Pázmány in Budapest 
was András Horvath.  András was extremely generous with his time, helping us learn 
TensorFlow, debug and write code, and understand difficult concepts.  We could not 
have done our research without him.
