## Collaborators
My research was funded by a 
[NSF IRES grant](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=12831) and
sponsored by Professor Michael Niemier at the University of Notre Dame, who I was in
frequent communication with throughout the summer (he was back in the United States).
Sophie Lancaster ([@slancas1](https://github.com/slancas1)), also an undergrad 
majoring in Computer Science at Notre Dame, was my research partner. My supervisor 
at Pázmány in Budapest was András Horvath.  András was extremely generous with his 
time, helping us learn TensorFlow, debug and write code, and understand difficult 
concepts.  We could not have done this research without him.

## Our Toolset
We used [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) to build and process neural 
networks. TensorFlow is a python library that integrates very nicely with
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org). See [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/)
if you are interested in learning to use TensorFlow.

## Convolutional Neural Networks
All of the networks we created throughout the research experience were Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNNs).  CNNs are a type of deep neural network extremely effective 
at processing, classifying, and recognizing images.  This 
[blog](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/) provides
a very good overview of CNNs.

## Our Datasets
* [Omniglot](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot): This data can be found in
[Omniglot_data](./Omniglot_data).

* [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/): This data can be found in
[MNIST_data](./MNIST_data).

* [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html): This data was too large
to upload to GitHub.
