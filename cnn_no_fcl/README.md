## Cellular Neural Networks (CeNNs)
The code in this directory focuses on removing the fully connected layer from
convolutional neural networks (CoNNs) in an effort to make them friendly to an 
implementation on cellular neural networks (CeNNs).  CeNNs are like regular neural
networks, but they contain only local connections (see below photo).  This property
makes them extremely efficient to implement on computer chips.  See
[here](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Cellular_neural_network) for a more in
depth explanation of CeNNs.
